Project Goals:
Count diversity through ambiguous sites in sequences from different treatments with and without resistance mutations which will hopefully tell us something about soft sweeps

This includes data from 13000 patients and approximately twice the number of sequences. These are patients that underwent first line therapy and were sequenced while they were still on the therapy. It excludes anyone being treated with “none” or “unknown” and had both PR and RT sequences (maybe). Multiple clones per individual were included where available. Number of weeks on treatment was calculated by looking at the date at which treatment was started and the data at which the sample was taken. In cases where the treatment start date was unknown, weeks is marked to 52, and it’s listed in another column. These are only taken from HIV1 found in humans across multiple subtypes from group M (with 16 from group O, and 28 Unknown (?) ). They include mostly subtype B, with some other subtypes and some CRFs (circulating recombinant forms).
